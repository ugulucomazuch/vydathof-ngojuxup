The Cocktail Atlas takes readers around the world, through the lens of a cocktail glass, exploring the links between people, place, and taste.Â Â  Organized by continent, each country covered has a thorough (and often rollicking) description of its customs, indigenous food and drink, topography, distilling traditions, and cocktail scene. These are followed by at least one cocktail recipe, which is either an iconic beverage of the land or an original interpretation inspired by local ingredients, as well as nuggets and tidbits of knowledge guaranteed to come in handy at the next pub quiz. Visit Lebanon through a Za&amp;#039;atar Paloma; Cyprus via a Cypriot Brandy Sour; or the tiny Pacific island of Nauru through a Coffee Pineapple Old Fashioned. Â  Accompanied by illustrations of the cocktails and maps of each continent, this book is an exhaustively comprehensive, extensively researched, uniquely lively, and informative addition to any cocktail libraryâ€”perfect for novice or seasoned mixologists and world history buffs alike.Â
