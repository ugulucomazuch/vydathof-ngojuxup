Overview
Get set for a white-knuckle journey into magic and adventure as the impossible becomes the new normal in Bob Weis&#039; debut novel Ghost Dog! Herbert recently lost his beloved dog. His parents take him to Disneyland to cheer him up. Herbert rides The Haunted Mansion, and on this fateful night, a ghost really does follow him home. And not just any ghost, Herbert finds himself trying to keep a GHOST DOG, which only he can see, a secret. But Herbert is acting weird, and his parents and best friend Kasey know something is wrong. They try therapists, mystics, and even a seance back at Disneyland. But things only get worse. Herbertâ€™s new Ghost Dog attracts other ghosts from the mansion, and they are a rowdy bunch who turn Herbertâ€™s otherwise normal family upside down. To get the ghosts back where they belong, the family goes on a wild adventure across the country chasing science, design technology, braving ghostly occurrences, and nearly getting lost in a storm. Will they make it in time? Will Herbert be able to say goodbye to his ghost friends and his new Ghost Dog? A family adventure.
