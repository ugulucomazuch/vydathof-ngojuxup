Overview
An epic historical spy thriller from the author of the Scarecrow and Jack West Jr. series
 
 A SECRETARY LIKE NO OTHER IN AN EPIC SPANNING 40 YEARS
 
 All Hanna Fischer ever wanted to do was to study physics under the great Albert Einstein. But when, as a teenager in 1919, her life is suddenly turned upside-down, she is catapulted into a new and extraordinary life - as a secretary, a scientist, a sister and a spy.
 
 From racist gangs in Berlin to gangsters in New York City, Nazis in the 1930s and Hitler&#039;s inner circle during the Second World War, Hanna will encounter some of history&#039;s greatest minds and most terrible moments, all while desperately trying to stay alive. She is a most unique secretary and she will work for many bosses - from shrewd businessmen to vile Nazis, to the greatest boss of them all, Mr. Albert Einstein...
 
 Spanning forty years, this is the thrilling tale of a young woman propelled through history&#039;s most dangerous times. But read it carefully, because all may not be as it seems...
