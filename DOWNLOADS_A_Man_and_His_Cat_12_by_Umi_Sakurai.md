Overview
In this best-selling, heartwarming tale, a lonely older man takes home a pet-shop kitten that no one else wants. It doesnâ€™t take long for the pair to warm up to each other, and soon, theyâ€™re inseparable. Told through the eyes of both the man and his cat, this sweet and hilarious story is a balm for the soul!
 
 Kanda agonizes over the right cat tower for Fukumaru. Then, a lost dog shows up in Kanda&#039;s garden, and Sorako brings it inside?! A familiar face known online as &quot;twinkle_bell&quot; also intrigues a teenager who&#039;s stopped attending high school... Although Kanda and Fukumaru&#039;s simple life continues to change when Siam gets a new owner, the pair&#039;s bond grows deeper than ever.
