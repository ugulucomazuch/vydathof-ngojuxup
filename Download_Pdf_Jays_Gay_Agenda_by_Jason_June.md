## Review ebook online Jay's Gay Agenda 


Overview
From debut novelist Jason June comes a moving and hilarious sex-positive teen rom-com about the complexities of first loves, first hookups, and first heartbreaksâ€”and how to stay true to yourself while embracing what you never saw coming, thatâ€™s perfect for fans of Sandhya Menon and Becky Albertalli.Â  Thereâ€™s one thing Jay Collier knows for sureâ€”heâ€™s a statistical anomaly as the only out gay kid in his small rural Washington town. While all his friends canâ€™t stop talking about their heterosexual hookups and relationships, Jay can only dream of his own firsts, compiling a romance to-do list of all the things he hopes to one day experienceâ€”his Gay Agenda. Then, against all odds, Jayâ€™s family moves to Seattle and he starts his senior year at a new high school with a thriving LGBTQIA+ community. For the first time ever, Jay feels like heâ€™s found where he truly belongs. But as Jay begins crossing items off his list, heâ€™ll soon be torn between his heart and his hormones, his old friends and his new ones . . . because after all, life and love donâ€™t always go according to plan.Â
