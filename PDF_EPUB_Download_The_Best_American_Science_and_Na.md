Award-winning environmentalist, author, and journalist¬†Bill McKibben selects twenty science and nature essays that represent the best examples of the form published in the previous year. ‚ÄúThis was the most anomalous year (so far) in human history,‚Äù guest editor Bill McKibben writes, ‚Äúthe year in which the relationship between people and planet showed its most dramatic signs yet of unraveling.‚Äù The selections in The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2024 reveal a trying year for our planet‚Äîfrom the Lahaina wildfire tragedy to the lush Amazon jungle slowly turning to savanna‚Äîwhile also celebrating the earth‚Äôs beautiful and mysterious ways‚Äîfrom the largest beaver dam on earth to the heroic innovation to prevent birds from crashing into Chicago‚Äôs expanse of glass buildings. These essays offer solace in trying times, showing a way for a better future. They are, as McKibben says, ‚Äúa reminder that this world is still a lovely and deep place, well worth the fighting for.‚Äù The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2024¬†includes IAN FRAZIER ‚Ä¢ AMANDA GEFTER ‚Ä¢ DOUGLAS FOX ‚Ä¢ SARAH KAPLAN ‚Ä¢ BEN GOLDFARB ‚Ä¢ RAYMOND ZHONG ‚Ä¢ ALEX CUADROS ‚Ä¢ AND OTHERS
